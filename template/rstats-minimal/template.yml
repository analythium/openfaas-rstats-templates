  You have created a new function which uses R and the Classic
  OpenFaaS template.

  To include third-party dependencies, add packages to the PACKAGES
  file, one package per line (packagename or packagename@version) 
  which can be a remote, see
  https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/remotes/vignettes/dependencies.html

  For high-throughput applications, we recommend using the rstats-http
  template instead available via the store.
